## PURPOSE

pdlist is a passive subdomain finder written in python3. This tool can be used 
effectively to collect information about a domain without ever sending a 
single packet to any of its hosts.
Given a domain like "example.com" it will find all the hosts which
have a hostname `<something>.example.com` or URLs strictly related to example.com.

In order to collect informations about subdomains the software queries different
publicly available websites, which at the moment are:
- [threatcrowd](https://www.threatcrowd.org/)
- [urlscan](https://urlscan.io/)
- [hackertarget](https://hackertarget.com/)
- [dnsdumpster](https://dnsdumpster.com/)
- [crt.sh](https://crt.sh/)
- [certspotter](https://certspotter.com)


pdlist is very user-friendly and lightweight since the only dependencies are
the following python modules:
- requests
- BeautifulSoup4



## INSTALLATION

We can install pdlist simply by doing:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/gnebbia/pdlist
cd pdlist
pip install -r requirements.txt
python setup.py install
```

Notice that both pip and python should refer to version 3, so if you are not
using pyenv as I am doing you should probably substitute `pip` with `pip3` and
`python` with `python3`.


## USAGE

To have a list of subdomains passively of for example
[example.com](example.com) we can do:

```sh
pdlist example.com
```

we can also specify multiple domains, e.g.,;

```sh
pdlist example1.com example2.com
```

We can save the output in a text file by doing:
```sh
pdlist example.com -o example-list.txt
```

Notice that by default pdlist will also output hostnames which may not really
be proper subdomains of the specified domains, and this happens because those
subdomains are still related to the specified domains.

If we want to only output proper subdomains we can enable the strict mode by
doing:
```shs
pdlist example.com --strict
```

## NOTES

This is a minimalist passive domain finder, the aim of this project is to have
few dependencies, small code footprint and easily extensible.

If you want to extend the code it is enough to add a module in the `source`
package with a `def parse(domains)` method.



## TODO

* Add more passive recon sources
* Modify the code to work in asynchrounous mode
* Generate fancy html reports
